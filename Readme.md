# AWS Cloud Cost Calculator

The AWS Cloud Cost Calculator is a Spring Boot + ReactJS app built to quickly calculate and keep track of AWS resource costs. The form is dynamic — when you pick options like provider or region, it fetches the matching resource types from the backend and updates the dropdowns on the fly. You can add items to a cart, review them, and then confirm the order, which gets saved to a PostgreSQL database. Everything is structured with clear controller, service, repo, and model layers, making it easy to follow the flow from frontend to backend.

## Backend

#### Controller Layers
- `Resource Controller`: API Endpoints for fetching the details regarding the resources to the client.
- `Instance Controller`: Endpoints for fetching the resource types and its associated details.
- `Region Controller`: Endpoints for fetching the region names associated with a particular resource type, name and instance type. 
- `Compute Controller`: Endpoints to fetch the price per hour of a particular resource type, resource name and instance type inorder to compute the price per month of a particular resource.
- `Order Controller`: Endpoints to fetch all the confirmed orders which is stored in the database.

#### Service Layers: 
- `Resource Type Service`:  Service layer to pass data related to Resource types to Reesource Controller.
- `Resource Name Service`:  Service layer to pass data related to Resource names to Reesource Controller.
- `Region Service`:  Service layer to send data regarding region names and codes to Region Controller.
- `Order Service`:  Service layer to fecth the complete the complete order history.
- `Instance Type Service`:  Service layer to pass data related to instance types to Instance Controller. 
- `Compute Service`:  Service layer to process data to calculate the price per month  

#### Models: 
- `Instance Type`
- `Order History`
- `Region Code`
- `Region Names`
- `RequestFromUser`
- `ResourceName`
- `ResourcesTypes`
- `Response`
- `ErrorResponse`
- `SingleOrder`
- `SingleOrderDTO`

#### Repo Layer:
- `InstanceTypeRepo`: JPA Layer for Instance Type
- `Order Repo`: JPA Layer for OrderHistory
- `Region Repo`: JPA Layer for Region Names
- `ResourceNameRepo`: JPA Layer for Resource Name
- `ResourceTypeRepo`: JPA Layer for Resource Types

#### Exceptions: 
- `Global Exception Handler`: Handles thrown exceptions and returns proper error response  
- `ResourceNotFoundException`
- `valueNullException`

#### Database: 
Postgres is the database used here.
Database schema is given below :-

## Frontent

When the user fills out the form, each change in an input (like provider or region) triggers a `useFetch` call to the backend to retrieve the matching resource types, which are then shown in the resource type dropdown. Once the user chooses the desired options and adds the order to the cart, it’s stored temporarily in the frontend state for review. When the user confirms the cart, the entire order data is sent via a POST request to the backend, where it is saved in the database for record keeping.


## Setting up the dev ENV: 

### Backend
- Clone the repo
- ```cd backend```
- ```mvn clean install```
- ```mvn spring-boot:run```

### Frontend

- Run ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev```
